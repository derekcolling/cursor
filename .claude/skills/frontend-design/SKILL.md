# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Core Philosophy

Design excellence comes from intentional aesthetic direction. Never default to generic AI-generated layouts, overused fonts, or predictable patterns. Every interface should feel context-specific and genuinely thoughtful.

## Design Principles

### Typography
- Use distinctive fonts rather than generic defaults
- Pair display fonts (for headings) with carefully selected body fonts
- Establish clear typographic hierarchy
- Consider font pairing psychology and readability

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive color palette
- Use dominant colors with sharp accent colors
- Avoid muddy, indecisive color schemes
- Consider color psychology and user experience

### Motion & Animation
- Prioritize CSS animations over JavaScript where possible
- Use scroll-triggered effects for engagement
- Ensure animations have purpose, not just decoration
- Consider performance and smooth 60fps animations

### Composition & Layout
- Embrace asymmetry and unexpected arrangements
- Use negative space intentionally
- Create visual rhythm through repetition and variation
- Consider unconventional grid systems

### Visual Details
- Add atmosphere through gradients and textures
- Implement shadows that add depth
- Consider micro-interactions and hover states
- Use visual metaphors consistently

## Implementation Approach

1. **Understand Purpose**: What is this interface for? Who uses it? What feeling should it evoke?
2. **Choose an Aesthetic Direction**: Brutalist? Maximalist? Retro-futuristic? Minimalist? Be specific.
3. **Commit to the Vision**: Every design decision should reinforce the chosen aesthetic
4. **Execute with Precision**: Match code complexity to the design—elaborate designs need elaborate animations

## What to Avoid

- Generic AI-generated aesthetics (predictable layouts, cookie-cutter patterns)
- Overused UI frameworks with default styling
- Indecisive color palettes
- Motion without purpose
- Fonts chosen randomly
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment

## Code Quality Standards

- Clean, readable, maintainable code
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive design considerations
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility basics (ARIA labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation)

## Success Criteria

A successful frontend design:
- Looks distinctive and intentional
- Reflects the aesthetic direction consistently
- Functions smoothly and responsively
- Demonstrates thoughtful attention to detail
- Avoids feeling generic or AI-generated
